Developed a photoshop application using MATLAB, this application can be used to edit the photos captured in real time through webcam or the files selected from the user's folder using the MATLAB software. I used the snapshot function to capture single photo of the user and then have applied various functions on that image to enhance its quality and adding certain effects which can improve the visuals of the captured image. I have used various filters like cany and guassian for providing the blurring effects to the picture. Where the position of the respective iris effect can be decided by the user through the use of cursor bounding. Here for the ease and better resolution I have used Euclidean distance between the selected points so that the quality of the image can be enhanced.
